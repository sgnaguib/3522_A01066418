This tamagotchi game starts by asking the user to hatch a tamagatchi.
Once the tamagatchi is hatched, the user is directed to the main menu,
where he or she can select whether to check the tamagatchi's status,
feed it, or play with it.

The tamagotchis are dictators from European history

When a user checks a tamagotchi's status, the program displays
a string with the tamagotchi's name and its statistics, as well as
a message personalized to each tamagotchi. Stalin's message is
about his mustache, Napoleon's is just some french words, and
Mussolini's is just some Italian words. If any of the Tamagatchi's fall
sick, their message is 'I'm Sick :('

When a user feeds a tamagachi, the tamagatchi's hunger is
reduced by the food value common to all foods. If the food is
part of the tamagatchi's list of favorite food, his hunger is reduced by
an extra 10%. One of Napoleon's favourite foods is a baguette,
one of Mussolini's is Spaghetti and one of Stalin's is cabbage.

Feeding a tamagotchi medicine restorea its health completely.

As for playing with a tamagatchi, it works as follows. Each game
has a base fun value. Each tamagatchi has a playfulness index which
decides how many extra happiness points it recieves when a user
plays an activity with it.

Otherwise, everything else is pretty straightforward. Enjoy!
